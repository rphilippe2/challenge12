          Hi, I’m Ricardo Philippe, a 37-year-old passionate web developer with a love for crafting digital experiences that are both functional and visually compelling. I’m a husband and father of two, which means my life is as full of adventure at home as it is in my coding projects!

In November 2024, I earned my Full Stack Web Development Certificate from the University of Central Florida, where I honed my skills in both front-end and back-end technologies. Whether I’m building responsive websites, developing dynamic web applications, or integrating complex databases, I’m always focused on creating solutions that meet both client and user needs.

With every project, I bring a blend of creativity, technical expertise, and problem-solving to the table. When I’m not coding, you’ll find me spending time with my family or exploring the latest tech trends.
